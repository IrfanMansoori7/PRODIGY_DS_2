In this project, a predictive model was created to determine Titanic passenger survival based on features such as age, fare, and class. Due to issues with the original dataset, a new dataset was generated using the `faker` library to ensure proper functionality. The model's effectiveness was assessed through detailed evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices, to ensure reliable performance.
